# wu-daily-training-spreadsheet

Experimental google docs/drive and vuejs

Demo:
- https://wu-daily-training-sheet.wlodi.net
- https://wu-daily-training-sheet.wlodi.net/index.html?devopt=no-image (without images from google drive)

Why is it so great?!
1. Free 'CMS'.
2. Just simple frontend app - without js dependencies.
3. Publication/editingis provide by external sources google-docs - 'CMS' clients are available for browser and mobile, free, provide tools to manage access for users (by link or gmail account), parallel data management.
4. Developer can switch beetwen 'prod' and 'dev' data by change a link to another gdocs with limited privileges.
5. Free tools to check traffic from google.

Above points it's not glorification google - I jut describe idea - for some simple/free solution to provide cheaper solutions and more available for user and developers - 'Excel' as a CMS. In this type of solutions - I think the biggest challenge is the parallel access to resources and user roles (and their management) - in my example you've it for free.

## Dependencies

JS Libraries:

- Vue.js (2.6.14)
- Google API
- Views (https://github.com/adrianklimek/views)
- lazysizes (https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes)

CSS:

- Material Icons (https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline)
- Font from Google (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)

DEV:

## Developer notes

Website URL contains [devopt] parameter - it can be used for developers to skip following operations:

- no-image - skip call for images from external resource
- no-data - skip call for all data from external resource

You can use any delimiter in query (order is no matter) - excluding RFC standard (&, ? etc.), for example:

```sh
(...)?devopt=no-image||no-data
(...)?devopt=no-image_no-data
(...)?devopt=no-data_no-image
(...)?devopt=no-datano-image
```
